This is my capstone project for my bachelor's degree at WGU. It consists of a rudimentary supervised regression machine-learning program that takes in a variety of behavioral factors from a student and uses them to predict the student's exam score. The program with developed with Jupyter notebook and Python and uses the CatBoostRegressor model to mix categorical and numeric inputs in order to provide a singular numeric answer. It also includes MSE and r2 score testing as well as visualizations of some of the most important aspects of the data.
