This is my capstone project for my bachelor's degree at WGU. It consists of a rudimentary machine-learning program that takes in a variety of factors from a student and uses it to predict their exam score. The program with developed with Jupyter notebook and Python and uses the CatBoostRegressor model to mix categorical and numeric inputs in order to provide a singular numeric answer.
